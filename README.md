## Setup & Running:
- Extract **Zoidberg.App.zip** to a folder (C:\ZoidbergApp Required for the **Path.bat** files to work).

- Run **Zoidberg.exe** by double-clicking or from a terminal.

**You do not need these dependencies for the .exe file.**


## Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows (Compiled for Windows).

## Troubleshooting

- **"Image not found" Error:** Ensure the main Zoidberg image *(Zoidberg Icon.png)* is located in a subfolder named Zoidberg/ right next to your Zoidberg.exe file.
For example: **```C:\ZoidbergApp\Zoidberg\Zoidberg Icon.png```**

- **"Config Created" Repeatedly:** config.ini might be missing or misplaced; ensure it's with Zoidberg.exe.

- **Command-line Arguments Not Working:** Check quotes for multi-word/color values, and ensure you're using a new terminal window after PATH changes. 


- **Antivirus Warnings:** Compiled .exe files can be flagged. If this occurs, you may need to add an exception for Zoidberg.exe in your antivirus settings.
