## Troubleshooting

**"Image not found" Error:** Ensure the main Zoidberg image *(Zoidberg 324.png)* is located in a subfolder named Zoidberg/ right next to your Zoidberg.exe file.
For example: **C:\ZoidbergApp\Zoidberg\Zoidberg 324.png.**

**"Config Created" Repeatedly:** config.ini might be missing or misplaced; ensure it's with Zoidberg.exe.

**Command-line Arguments Not Working:** Check quotes for multi-word/color values, and ensure you're using a new terminal window after PATH changes. 


**Antivirus Warnings:** Compiled .exe files can be flagged. If this occurs, you may need to add an exception for Zoidberg.exe in your antivirus settings.


## Unsettling Command Line Arguements

**"Weird Mode" Command:** 
Zoidberg.exe -t "All Glory to the Hypnotoad!" -tc "#FF0000" -bgg1 "#00FF00" -bgg2 "#FF00FF"

This sets text to "All Glory to the Hypnotoad!", text color to bright red, and a gradient from neon green to bright pink.

**"Ominous Mode" Command:**
Zoidberg.exe -t "The shadows awaken..." -tc "#c0c0c0" -bgg1 "#1a0a2e" -bgg2 "#0a0a0a"

This sets text to "The shadows awaken...", text color to silver/gray, and a gradient from dark purple to black.
